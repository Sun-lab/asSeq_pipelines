Information for three example gene processed according to asSeq pipeline, includes
+ TReC_ex.txt - total read counts
+ ASReC_hap1_ex.dat - haplotype 1 allele specific counts
+ ASReC_hap2_ex.dat - haplotype 2 allele specific counts
+ Info_ex.txt - gene information file
+ samples.dat - design matrix information including log(sample depth) and several PCs

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Files Tcnt_ex.dat and samples.dat will be reformatted to be used by RASQUAL: Y.bin, X.bin and K.bin

# Tcnt -> TReC, A1_ex.dat to ASReC_hap1_ex.txt and A2 tp ASReC_hap2, add explanation for other files such as GE_ex.dat
=======
Additionally, individual level data including TReC, ASReC_hap1, ASReC_hap2 and ASReC_hapN (conflicting reads) is provided.

Note: In case of running RASQUAL pipeline files Tcnt_ex.dat and samples.dat should be reformatted to be used by RASQUAL: Y.bin, X.bin and K.bin
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
